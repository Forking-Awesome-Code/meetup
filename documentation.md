Using this plugin is really easy. First of all, we will learn about creating new meetup here.

###Create a new meetup

Navigete to wp-admin -> Meetup -> Create New

Now we will have the screen to create a new meetup. Like any other WordPress post, this is a post type and only the title is required. But you should put all the values to look good and provide your event attendees a better experience.

After writing all your details, hit publish.

You will have a link to view the post. Clicking on that button will take you to the event page. If you want to show the event page in a menu item, then you can copy the link and create a custom menu item from wp-admin -> Appearance -> Menu.

That's all. No shortcodes required!
